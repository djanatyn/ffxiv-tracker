# ffxiv-tracker

Fetch snapshots of experience levels for jobs from lodestone.

# TODO
- [ ] serialize snapshots to sqlite
- [ ] create visualization using chart.js from sqlite
- [ ] create standalone page which visualizes experience graph client-side with sqlite db
- [ ] create small web-service which allows tracking results over time from the browser (just hit refresh like fflogs)
